<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

<h2 align="center"><b>Welcome to my page!</b></h2>

<p align="center">Hey! Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is K*** L****, and I am a member of the Girls Who Code sisterhood. I am also a part of my school's track team, basketball team, national honor society, national music honor society, jazz choir, chorale choir, puzzle club, and new generation club. I enjoy hanging out with friends, drinking boba, and playing with hypoallergenic puppies. In my free time, I read :)</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<p>  ~My go-to Starbucks drinks are the Vanilla Bean Frapp when it's warm and the hot chocolate when it's chilly. </p>
<p>  ~Tadashi from Big Hero Six is my favorite Disney character. </p>

<h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
<p> Some foods I like are boba, spam musubi, and pho. For the most part I never really dislike food LOL but if I have something too many times in a row, I'll get tired of it. </p>

<h2>Daily Reflections</h2>
<p><ins>7/10/17</ins>: Today at GWC we started to design this website. One of the focuses of the day was to make websites accessible to all users, so I worked with the color scheme, the font style, and sizing to make the text easily visible. On some other girls' websites, I saw line breaks and collages that were particularly aesthetic, and I would be interested in learning how to code those things for my own site as well. I am most proud of becoming comfortable with even just this small bit of the html language, because I can see my work coming to life as I put more effort in to understanding html. I'm excited for the weeks to come, and I plan to put my best effort into learning how to code! </p>
